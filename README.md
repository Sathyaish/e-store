# EStore

See the app live in action here https://roopkt.github.io/e-store

This project is inspired by Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) philosophy. 
There is an initiative going on to create prototype SOA here in this link https://github.com/Particular/Workshop.Microservices

This project is following the above prototype and trying to solve client side composition using ngrx4 and angular4 technology.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
